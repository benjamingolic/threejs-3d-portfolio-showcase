# ThreeJS 3D Portfolio-Showcase
## 🎨 About the Project

This project is part of the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course. It features an interactive 3D model of a MacBook that displays an embedded iFrame of my personal portfolio for desktop users.

**Future Update:** In the future, the project will also include a 3D model of an iPhone for the mobile version of the portfolio. The iPhone model will adapt to mobile screen sizes and display a mobile-optimized version of the portfolio.

## 🚀 The Portfolio:

## 🛠️ iPhone Version (Future)

The iPhone version will be added in a future update. The idea is to create a responsive mobile version of the portfolio, displayed inside a 3D iPhone model using the same Three.js approach as the MacBook version. Stay tuned for updates!
