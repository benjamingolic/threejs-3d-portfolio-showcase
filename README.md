# ThreeJS 3D Portfolio-Showcase
## üé® About the Project

This project is part of the [Three.js Journey](https://threejs-journey.com/) course. It features an interactive 3D experience showcasing both desktop and mobile-optimized versions of my portfolio. For desktop users, the project displays a 3D model of a MacBook, while mobile users will see a 3D model of an iPhone. The experience is further enriched by additional 3D models, including a RedBull can and AirPods Pro. Each device model adapts to the user's screen size and displays an embedded version of my personal portfolio.
